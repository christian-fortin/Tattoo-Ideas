<h3> This project was built to play around with website design and to learn to deploy with AWS since that is a very common platform in the tech industry. I learned that there is alot going on in AWS and they do a broad range of things. I deployed with the S3 storage device. It is a bit confusing at first, they don't walk you through it and you have to look up alot of different things for basic deployment. However once I did deploy it it became easy, besides the horrible UI/UX design. The first time I wanted to go back and look at my project through AWS it took some time to actually find it.</h3>
